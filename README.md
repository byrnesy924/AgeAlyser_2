Experiments in Analyzing AOE2 Recorded Games

### Utilities
- [AOE Pulse - very cool Opening strategy analytics work that is similar to what I'm doing](https://www.aoepulse.com/home)
- [The Original Repository for AOE Opening Analysis](https://github.com/dj0wns/AoE_Rec_Opening_Analysis/tree/main)
- [Relic/MS Documentation](https://wiki.librematch.org/librematch/data_sources/start)
- [Download Recs Manually @ aoe2recs.com](https://aoe2recs.com/)
- [AOE 2 rules for content](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/developers/rules)


### Idea
- Need a way to download top rec games
- Use parser to extract features of top games
    - resource collection
    - Starting question: 1TC vs 2 TC vs 3 TC play
- perform an interesting analysis of strategies, maybe using ML

Iterate back and forth on points 2 and 3
